# Types of languages

**Procedural**
	- well-structured steps .
	- Procedures to compose a program.
	 
**Functional**
	-Writing the program in pure functions

**Object Oriented**
	-Code + Data = Object



**STATIC VS DYNAMIC LANGUAGES**

**STATIC**  
- Perform type checking at compile time                         
- Errors will show at compile time
- Declare datatype before you use it
- More control

**DYNAMIC**
- Perform type checking at runtime
- Error might not show till program is run
- No need to declare datatype of variables
- Saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime


**Static & Heap Memory**

a = 10

a - Reference Variable Stores in **Stack Memory**
10 - Object Stores in **Heap Memory**

**Note**
- More than one variable can point to same object if anyone of them change then Orginal object will change
- Java is pass by reference variable
